# NonlinearOpMethods
  Developing package encompassing nonlinear optimization methods.
  This package was implemented in a Undergraduate research at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. 
  
  The methods present in this package are:
  * Backtracking line search;
  * Quasi-Newton method;
  * Golden Section method;
  * Gradient by numerical approximation;
  * Gradient Projection;
  * Hooke and Jeeves algorithm (Pattern search);
  * Quadratic Interpolation Method;
  
  **Ps.:** All functions are documented with usage examples!
  
  **Ps2.:** Any input and questions are welcome!
