Title: Developing package encompassing nonlinear optimization methods
Description: This package has the implementation of some numeric methods 
    for restricted and unrestricted nonlinear optimization problems. 
    The implemented algorithms have several references that allowed to 
    add some aspects of implementation to ensure better approximations to 
    the optimal point for nonlinear optimization problems. Available methods 
    are backtracking, bracketing, golden section, Hooke-and-Jeeves algorithm, 
    quadratic interpolation and quasi-Newton.
